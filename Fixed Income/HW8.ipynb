    "The critique of the Giants' valuation theory hinges on the enforceability of the Market Quotation clause. First, it argues that the clause is unenforceable in bankruptcy proceedings if it detrimentally affects the rights of the defaulting party. Furthermore, it claims that additional clauses acquired as compensation for bearing the risk of ARS instead of LIBOR on its books stipulate that upon an early termination requiring such market valuation, Lehman would be afforded the necessary time to solicit quotations and full prerogatives over the presentation of economic facts to designatd dealers in order to prevent undue impingement of the contract's values due to momentary market instability. Finally, it claims that invocation of termination clauses by Giants Stadium which leave it in default of its minimum hedging requirements must be expressly approved by Lehman to be enacted. <br>\n",
    "Additionally, prior to Lehman's defaults, much of the bonds went unsold and thus were held by Lehman, in which case the floating rate was stipulated to amount to 90% of LIBOR, accordingly this left them roughly $60 Million in-the-money in a September '08 valuation statement which Giants Stadium did not contest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, the issue with Lehmann's position is that under the conventional ISDA Master Agreement and commonly accepted practices around such transactions, the non-defaulting party is afforded the right to solicit settlement on market terms through the solicitation of such quotes. This is done in order that the contract be allowed to persist at its projected economic value should this be possible. Thus, although Lehman claims to have obtained a number of protective clauses as direct compensation for bearing the added risk of the ARS rate on its books, Giants Stadium can expect that its long-term hedge can be valued using a methodology which incorporates the long-term value it purchased the contract for. Lehman's position thus fails to reflect the economic value of the contract and is legally exposed should it be deemed to be seeking market valuation in bad faith (and/or to be interpreting the default clause in bad faith vis-a-vis the enforcement exemption it is arguing).
